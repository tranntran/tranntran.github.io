I am a dual-title PhD student in Statistics and Social Data Analytics at the Pennsylvania State University. My research interests are statistical data privacy, text analysis, and applications of Statistics on social issues. I am currently working with Dr. Aleksandra Slavkovic and Dr. Matthew Reimherr. 

Before joinning Penn State, I got my BBA in Actuarial Science from Temple University, where I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Krupa Viswanathan. 

## Research and Softwares
I am currently developing [binomialDP](https://tranntran.github.io/binomialDP/), an R package that aids the process of differentially private inference on binomial data. I am also working on generating synthetic heavy-tailed data.
